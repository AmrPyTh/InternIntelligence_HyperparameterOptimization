# InternIntelligence_HyperparameterOptimization

This repository contains the work I completed as part of my internship with **@InternIntelligence**, focusing on optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve its performance.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this task was to boost the performance of a classification model by tuning its hyperparameters using industry-standard optimization techniques.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- **Grid Search**
- **Randomized Search**
- **Cross-Validation**
- **Scikit-learn pipelines**
- **Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**

## 🧠 Model Info

- **Model Type:** (e.g., Random Forest / XgBoost / Logistic Regression)  
- **Dataset Used:** (e.g., Iris / Breast Cancer / Custom Dataset)  
- **Metric Improved:** (e.g., Accuracy improved from 85% ➡️ 96%)
